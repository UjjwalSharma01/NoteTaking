# Encrypted Notes App - Development Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture (30 minutes)
- [x] Initialize Next.js project with JavaScript
- [x] Set up p### âœ… Dark/Light Mode Theme Switching Issue (RESOLVED)
**Problem**: `useTheme must be used within a ThemeProvider` error occurred when trying to use theme functionality.

**Root Cause**: The root layout was a client component with providers directly embedded, causing hydration and context initialization issues.

**Solution**:
1. âœ… Created a separate `Providers.js` component marked as `'use client'`
2. âœ… Converted root layout back to server component using metadata export
3. âœ… Added theme persistence script to prevent flash of wrong theme
4. âœ… Used `suppressHydrationWarning` to handle theme hydration differences
5. âœ… Removed conditional rendering that was blocking provider initialization

**Files Changed**:
- `/src/app/layout.js` - Server component with proper metadata
- `/src/components/Providers.js` - Client component wrapper for providers
